HappyLittleCloud
================

Happy Little Cloud is an application for the ISU Microsoft Kinect Hackathon in January 2014.


##Overview
======
Created in 24 hours by a team of three, Happy Little Cloud is the result of a hackathon with the theme of influencing people. With this theme, the team decided to create a simple game depicting the story of a rain drop looking to make a difference to a town in peril. 
To interface with the kinect, we utilized software which read kinect movements and responded with keypresses. This software, called FAAST is found [here](http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/faast/).


##Controls
========
Run the .jar file
Use 'a' and 'd' keys to move left and right.
Collect raindrops to win!
